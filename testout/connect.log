Enhancements in banking oversight were notably implemented following the global financial crisis, driven by mandates for banks to maintain increased capital reserves and liquid assets, along with rigorous stress testing to ensure fortitude against adverse economic shocks.\n\nDespite these measures, the global financial architecture is exhibiting substantial vulnerabilities as escalating interest rates erode confidence in certain institutions. The collapses of Silicon Valley Bank and Signature Bank in the United States—attributed to the mass withdrawal of uninsured depositors recognizing significant losses in the banks’ securities portfolios induced by high interest rates—and the government-facilitated acquisition of Switzerland’s Credit Suisse by competitor UBS, have destabilized market assurance and precipitated substantial emergency interventions by regulatory authorities.\n\nThe latest Global Financial Stability Report highlights that risks to both banking and nonbank financial intermediaries have soared as central banks aggressively hike interest rates to curb inflation. Historically, such assertive rate escalations have been linked to stressors that reveal critical weaknesses within the financial ecosystem.\n\nIn its capacity of evaluating global financial stability, the IMF has identified deficiencies in the oversight, regulation, and resolution frameworks of financial entities. Previous Global Financial Stability Reports have cautioned about pressures on banking and nonbank financial intermediaries in the context of elevated interest rates.\n\nIt’s noteworthy that recent banking turbulence is distinct from the pre-2008 financial crisis scenario. Prior to 2008, most banks were drastically undercapitalized by contemporary standards, possessed fewer liquid assets, and were heavily exposed to credit risk. Additionally, the broader financial system engaged in excessive maturity and credit risk transformation, encompassing highly complex financial instruments and risky assets primarily financed by short-term borrowings. Problems originating in certain banks rapidly extended to nonbank financial firms and other entities due to their interconnectedness.\n\nContrastingly, the recent disruption differs fundamentally. The banking sector is now equipped with more robust capital and funding buffers to endure adverse economic shocks, off-balance-sheet entities have been dismantled, and credit risks have been mitigated by stringent post-crisis regulations. However, an intersection of rapidly rising interest rates and swiftly expanding financial institutions unprepared for such increases precipitated current challenges.\n\nSimultaneously, we have observed that issues at smaller'}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': 'institutions can engender broader confidence crises, even within a more robustly capitalized banking sector. The current financial landscape reveals that despite enhanced capital buffers and regulatory measures, systemic vulnerabilities persist due to several primary catalysts of financial risks:\n\n1. **Interest Rate Sensitivity**: Rapidly rising interest rates, as central banks strive to control inflation, can erode the value of securities portfolios, impair the asset quality, and reduce the net interest margins of financial institutions. This interest rate sensitivity is especially pronounced for banks holding significant long-duration assets, which lose value as rates climb.\n\n2. **Liquidity Risk and Deposit Flight**: The accelerated withdrawal of deposits, particularly uninsured ones, can strain liquidity reserves. The recent collapses of Silicon Valley Bank and Signature Bank highlight how a sudden loss of depositor confidence can lead to liquidity crises, requiring urgent regulatory intervention.\n\n3. **Interconnectedness and Contagion**: Financial entities, while better capitalized individually, remain interconnected. Issues in one institution can dampen confidence across the sector, causing a ripple effect that can destabilize other banks and nonbank financial intermediaries. This interconnectedness can propagate financial stress across the system.\n\n4. **Regulatory and Supervisory Gaps**: Despite improvements, deficiencies in the oversight, regulation, and resolution frameworks of financial entities exist. Such gaps can lead to delayed or inadequate responses to emerging risks, exacerbating financial instability.\n\n5. **Structural Changes in Financial Markets**: While stricter post-crisis regulations have dismantled off-balance-sheet entities and reduced excessive maturity and credit risk transformation, new structural changes have emerged. The rapid growth of certain financial institutions and the evolution of financial products and markets bring their own set of risks, sometimes unforeseen, which can challenge regulators.\n\n6. **Market Confidence and Psychological Factors**: Market sentiment and confidence play a crucial role. Events like the government-facilitated acquisition of Credit Suisse by UBS can unsettle stakeholders and introduce uncertainty, leading to broader market volatility and necessitating regulatory action.\n\nIn summary, while the banking sector post-2008 is more resilient with higher capital reserves, greater liquidity, and enhanced regulatory oversight, the rapidly changing economic conditions, particularly regarding interest rates, continue to present formidable challenges. The systemic financial risks are not only a function of economic fundamentals but are also driven by market perception, interconnectedness, and operational readiness to handle sudden market shifts. Effective mitigation requires continuous vigilance and adaptation of regulatory frameworks to address evolving vulnerabilities.'}]

These maritime DGPS receivers are, however, easy to disrupt using £50 jammer devices.\nDGPS signal disruption, particularly when ships are navigating through narrow inshore waters, could result in inaccurate positional information, leading to more maritime accidents.\nFor the study, academics from the Nottingham Geospatial Institute (NGI) and Royal Norwegian Naval Academy (RNoNA) Navigation Centre tested DGPS disruption in the shipping lanes of the Norwegian straits where navigational errors are said to account for half of accidents.\nDr Lukasz Bonenberg, senior technical officer at the NGI, said: “Main factors behind maritime accidents in this part of Norway are an influx of foreign vessels, coupled with quickly changing weather conditions and the dangerous nature of the narrow inshore waters.\n“In these difficult conditions, with a need for high-accuracy navigation, there tends to be an over-dependence on DGPS technology which can lead to a false feeling of security. These errors have increased significantly since the introduction of DGPS on most ships.\nAccording to Nottingham University, the trial was conducted with the high-end surveying grade receiver and antenna, which was placed on the shore with the jammer moving towards or away from the receiver on a small boat.\nThe aim of the trial was to quantify the jamming effect, simulating a vessel’s approach to a narrow inshore strait. The researchers found that the DGPS receiver didn’t stop functioning altogether. Instead it gave false readings in the on-board navigation system with positional data moving more than 10m.\nThe research team looked at a solution that would fix and maintain a transporter ship’s position more accurately and quickly using additional GPS signal frequencies instead of upgrading navigational systems on board.\nCurrently, the majority of maritime receivers are categorised as DGPS L1. Authors suggest combining this system with the multi-frequency GLONASS receiver – an alternative navigation system to GPS – is advantageous because the frequency band of GPS and GLONASS signals is much wider than dual L1 and L2 frequency GPS or GLONASS alone, increasing positional precision.\nThis has been traced back, not only to the increased number of satellites used, but also to the higher elevation and better coverage of the GLONASS satellites operated by the Russian Aerospace Defence Forces.\nGPS signalling is currently undergoing modernisation, which includes an additional frequency (L5) and an open L2C code on an L2 frequency. Currently, only a limited number of satellites offer these signals. Data observed during this experiment suggests that use of this modernised signal will offer advantages similar to the multi-frequency GLONASS one.\nAs with other safety-critical GNSS-dependent activities, there is a clear global requirement for a non-space-based alternative timing and positioning system. Don’t forget that global banking and other financial systems use GPS for critical timing data.\nYou might be surprised to discover that there is a suitable terrestrial alternative, called eLoran, which complements GPS and other GNSS very well. You might not be surprised to discover that governments aren’t interested in funding it.\nI agree with Tim. If we have a powerful solar storm and it knocked down our satellites then a ground based timing and positioning system would be a life saver.\nAs for funding such a system by governments then all I can say if we have Engineers and Scientists elected to heads governments (as in Germany for example) then funding will be highly likely!\nThere are other means to help confirm positions such as a known depth (chart), radar positioning or even looking out of the window (if close to land). These could of course be automated as a back up to check the integrity of the satellite position.\nI recall the pilots describing the clear instruction in their ‘standing-orders’ to occasionally look out of the window to see that the coast-line over which they were flying was indeed the same as that the ‘systems’ assured them they were crossing! This particularly when the auto-pilot asked for confirmation of a course change.\nApparently, early versions of what became “sat-nav” could indeed position the aircraft at a point exactly 180 degrees (ie on the opposite ‘side’ of our planet) from whence it supposed it was. I thought it was a practical joke, played upon un-suspecting punters by young pilots having some fun: until they showed me the rope down which they were supposed to shimmy, which deployed from the cockpit window, in the event of a problem. No, the flight was NOT on April 1st either. It was apparently poor form for the pilot to go first!\nWhat is eLoran and how can it complement GPS and other GNSS systems for positioning and timing?'}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': 'eLoran, or Enhanced Long Range Navigation, is a modernized version of the older Loran-C (Long Range Navigation) system. It is a terrestrial navigation system using radio signals transmitted from ground-based stations to provide accurate positioning and timing information. Here’s how eLoran can complement GPS and other Global Navigation Satellite Systems (GNSS):\n\n### How eLoran Works\neLoran operates by transmitting low frequency (LF) radio signals from a network of terrestrial transmission stations. A receiver can calculate its position based on the time difference of arrival (TDOA) of these signals from multiple stations. The system also provides precise timing data that can be used similarly to GPS.\n\n### Complementary Aspects to GPS and GNSS\n\n1. **Resilience to Jamming and Interference**:\n    - **Terrestrial-Based**: Unlike GNSS systems, which are space-based and thus have signals that can be relatively weak and easily jammed, eLoran’s terrestrial signals are stronger and more resilient to common jamming devices.\n    - **Low Frequency Operations**: eLoran operates at low frequencies (around 100 kHz), which makes the signals less susceptible to certain types of interference and able to penetrate deeper into urban and indoor environments where GNSS signals might struggle.\n\n2. **High-Accuracy Timing**:\n    - **Timing Source**: eLoran’s timing accuracy is sufficient for applications like network synchronization in telecommunications and financial systems, thereby offering a complementary or even backup source to the timing information provided by GPS, which is critical for these systems.\n\n3. **Coverage in Difficult Environments**:\n    - **Better Coverage in Specific Areas**: eLoran signals can cover regions where GNSS signals could be weak or unavailable, such as deep canyons, urban canyons, forests, and high-latitude areas.\n    - **Operational in High Latitudes**: GLONASS, another GNSS managed by Russia, is designed to have better coverage in high latitudes, similar to eLoran, providing redundancy in those challenging areas.\n\n4. **Robustness to Space Weather Events**:\n    - **Solar Storms**: eLoran is largely unaffected by space weather phenomena that can disrupt GNSS signals, including solar flares and geomagnetic storms, which makes it a robust backup to satellite-based systems.\n\n5. **Fallback System in Case of GNSS Failure**:\n    - **Non-Space-Based Alternative**: eLoran provides an independent, terrestrial-based system to fall back on if GNSS services are disrupted due to factors like satellite malfunctions, cyber-attacks, or maintenance periods.\n    \n6. **Compatibility with Existing Infrastructure**:\n    - **Infrastructure Integration**: eLoran can be integrated with existing infrastructure, making it a cost-effective addition to augment the reliability and robustness of location and timing services.\n\n### Practical Usage in Maritime Navigation\n- **Enhanced Positional Accuracy**: Using eLoran, maritime vessels can improve positional accuracy, especially in narrow inshore waterways where GNSS signal interruptions could have dire consequences.\n- **Navigational Redundancy**: Ships can employ eLoran in conjunction with multi-frequency GNSS (like GPS and GLONASS) to validate and cross-check positions, reducing the risk of navigational errors.\n\n### Conclusion\neLoran represents a robust, complementary solution to GNSS by providing an additional, reliable source of positioning and timing data. This dual-system approach enhances overall resilience, especially in critical applications where interruptions can have significant safety, economic, or operational impacts. Despite its advantages, widespread adoption might be limited unless there is substantial governmental or organizational investment and support.'}]
